									<span>Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But I do think it is their husbands’ faults</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or scant our former having in despite;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As husbands have. What is it that they do</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I think it is: and doth affection breed it?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I think it doth: is’t frailty that thus errs?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It is so too: and have not we affections,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</span>
