									<br/>

									<span>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</span>

									<br/>
									<span>That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</span>

									<span>’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful:</span>

									<span>She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d</span>

									<span>Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If I would time expend with such a snipe.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And it is thought abroad, that ’twixt my sheets</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He has done my office: I know not if’t be true;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The better shall my purpose work on him.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Cassio’s a proper man: let me see now:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To get his place and to plume up my will</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In double knavery⁠—How, how? Let’s see:⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That he is too familiar with his wife.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He hath a person and a smooth dispose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To be suspected, framed to make women false.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The Moor is of a free and open nature,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And will as tenderly be led by the nose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As asses are.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I have’t. It is engender’d. Hell and night</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit.</i></span>
